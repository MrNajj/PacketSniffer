# PacketSniffer

## Intro
Every time you visit a website, stream a video, oe send a message, your computer is constantly sending and receiving chunks of data called packets. These packets travel across the internet through your devices and servers around the world, and you usually would never see them. 

## What the PacketSniffer achieves  
This program makes that traffic which is invisible to the user visible. The project sits in the background and watches/sniffs every packet moving in and out of your machine in live time.
Every packet it catches it breaks it down and explain its details in plain english.
- where the data is coming from (Source)
- where the data is going (Destination)
- Type of data it is (IP, TCP, UDP, DNS, DNSQR)
- Geo-location (city or country) of the destination server is located in

## How to run PacketSniffer

This program is built on Python and extensively uses the Scappy library.
